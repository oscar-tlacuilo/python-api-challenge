VacationPy
VacationPy is a Python script that helps users plan vacations by analyzing weather data. It fetches current weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API for cities worldwide and filters them based on user-defined weather preferences. Then, using the Geoapify API, it finds nearby hotels for the selected cities and visualizes them on a map.

WeatherPy
WeatherPy, a Jupyter Notebook, explores the relationship between weather parameters (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed) and latitude. It analyzes weather data from numerous global cities, generates scatter plots, and conducts linear regression to reveal insights into how weather varies with latitude. Together, VacationPy and WeatherPy provide valuable insights for vacation planning based on weather conditions.
